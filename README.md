# PACE (2026): Hsien Tang Chen

### Poway HomeDepot
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Went Well

-   **OrderUp** -- Strong tool. I've learned to use it efficiently and
    continue finding better ways to work inside it.\
-   **Fulfillment Team** -- Reliable, fast under short deadlines, and
    willing to support Special Services when needed.\
-   **MET Team** -- Consistently reset the floor (Halloween → Christmas
    → Spring) smoothly and professionally. Big visible impact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Went Not So Well

### Lack of Backup (BAR Increasing)

-   My "Backup Answered Rate" (BAR) used to be \~3 calls.\
-   Recently it has increased to 5+ calls before help arrives.\
-   Idle time in other departments while Service Desk is calling for
    backup...

### Poor Phone Responsiveness

-   Many HD phone calls go unanswered.
-   Transferred customer calls often bounce back.
-   When MOD enforced "keep HD phone on, keep communicate on the phone," response improved immediately.

### "Kicking the Can" Culture

-   Some long-standing issues remain tolerated instead of resolved.\
-   Military phone ID misuse continues.\
-   No-receipt return loophole (splitting large returns into smaller
    transactions).\
-   Return/POS inconsistencies create uneven enforcement.\
-   Got kicked down the street....

### "Not Seeing the Elephant in the Room" (AI)

-   HD.com has at least two AI chat tools.\
-   I've used them at work; they are helpful.\
-   It is 2026 and there has been no in-store rollout or adoption.\
-   Are we giving up the race to Lowes (OpenAI's proxy) ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next 6 Months Goals

-   Continue improving OrderUp efficiency and resolution speed.\
-   Monitor Corporate AI direction and Pro customer response.\
-   Cross-train in Tool Rental to expand store contribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Support Requested

-   Opprtunity to help unleash the Elephant...
-   Clearer enforcement of backup expectations and phone responsiveness.\
-   Escalation path for recurring system flaws.
