## What Went Well

## I feel positive on Team and Tools
-   **OrderUp** -- Strong tool. I've learned to use it efficiently and
    continue finding better ways to work inside it.\
-   **Fulfillment Team** -- Reliable, fast under short deadlines, and
    willing to support Special Services when needed.\
-   **MET Team** -- Consistently reset the floor (Halloween → Christmas
    → Spring) smoothly and professionally. Big visible impact.

## 👀 I see Leadership

- **Dept 31** – Solid coaching. Real team building.  
- **David on HD phone** – “Let’s keep the phone on. Let's talk and reply over the phone. Lets make today a win day.”  
  That’s leadership. That’s orchestra energy.

---

## 📈 I see the value of Peformance Guidelines

- **LTPA Reviews** – Asking for LTPA reviews anchors performance and reinforces customer experience.  
- **Entrance Greeting Practice** – Strong first impression; improves in-store experience and opens sales opportunities.

## Went Not So Well (my thoughts)

---
### Need to Improve Accuracy + Tool Familiarity

- Need to get sharper with Tools: OrderUp, Return One, Pro Xtra, SPOS  
- Continuously improve accuracy.  

### Want to Better Understand the THD Ecosystem

- Want to dive into service providers + vendors  
- Want to understand logistics flow (who moves what, how, and when)  
- Need to learn full store workflow — not just Service Desk bubble  


### Hope to Gain Race Track Smart and Become Aisle Proficient

- Like to be able to answer cust questions with confidence + accuracy  
- Hope to stay alert on seasonal pushes

### Prep D-31 for 2026 EVgo Walk-Ins

- Background: EVgo chargers -> more walk-ins. Would be nice if we could prep D-31 for that opportunity.
- Suggest use of flyers and posters: key message "THD Efficiency: Charge your car. Get ready for your home project — all at the same time."
- Would be nice if we could explore the "EVgo-side" service concept.

### Urge to Keep BRC Counts Low

- BRC = Backup Request Calls. When surge in return line, we ring BRC.

- Before: it took 1.5 to 2 calls to get backup. Now: 4+ calls.

- I feel we are slipping here. Needs reinforcement.


### "On My Way" Reply = Orchestra, Urge the Practice

- We all carry HD phones. Calls heard by assoc and cust in store.  
- Many assoc don’t reply. No reply = off-beat music in the store.
- “On my way.” reply → Orchestra = Synced and Harmony.
- I feel MOD could do a better job to reinfocre. 

### Suggest to Face "Elephant in the Room" (AI)

-   HD.com has at least two AI chat tools.
-   I've used them at work. Helpful.
-   It is 2026, No real in-store rollout yet.
-   I fear that Lowes (OpenAI partnership) may gain upper hand
-   Would be nice if we could address this before it becomes reactive.

### Recommend Pro Demo Kiosk

- THD rolling out new AI tools; latest launched end of Jan.
- I spoke with many Pros--many display strong interest in AI tool. 
- I recommend to set up a kiosk in store.

## Something for me to Pick Up:

- **Rental Department** – Want to know how tools work.  
- Expand skill set.  
- Explore Pro Demo Kiosk idea with team.
- Explore EVgo-side/THD Efficiecy flyer idea with team.

---

## Next 6 Months Goals

-   Continue improving OrderUp efficiency and resolution speed.\
-   Monitor Corporate AI direction and Pro customer response.\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Support Requested

- Let me help tame the Elephant (practical use, to start with Pros!).
- Encourage MOD to play Conducutor and keep the in-store Orchestra. 
- Up my pay scale, please :-)
