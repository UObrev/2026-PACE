## What Went Well

## I feel positive on Team and Tool
-   **OrderUp** -- Strong tool. I've learned to use it efficiently and
    continue finding better ways to work inside it.\
-   **Fulfillment Team** -- Reliable, fast under short deadlines, and
    willing to support Special Services when needed.\
-   **MET Team** -- Consistently reset the floor (Halloween → Christmas
    → Spring) smoothly and professionally. Big visible impact.

---

## 👀 I see Leadership

- **Dept 31** – Solid coaching. Real team building.  
- **David on HD phone** – “Let’s keep the phone on. Let's talk and reply over the phone. Lets make today a win day.”  
  That’s leadership. That’s orchestra energy.

---

## 📈 I see the value of Peformance Guidelines

- **LTPA Reviews** – Asking for LTPA reviews anchors performance and reinforces customer experience.  
- **Entrance Greeting Practice** – Strong first impression; improves in-store experience and opens sales opportunities.

## Went Not So Well

---

### 🧟 Zombies in Parking Lot

- Two 40-ft trailers block store view. Traffic leaks to Costco. Why are they there?  
- We have a panoramic lot — most stores envy it.  
- Turn trailers into Electronic Billboard (BB). Form a task force to exploit. 
- Go aggressive. Use the space.

### 🧟 Zombie Zones (Inside Store)

Dead zones. No SKU motion. Poor image.

- **ZZ1** – Corridor behind Pro & Checkout (before the exits). Tool chest SKUs. Dusty. Low energy.  
- **ZZ2** – Head Cashier Vault. Gated. Tapes. Blocks (what for?). Looks messy.  

### Re-Layout DIY Self Checkout
- Tight. Cramped.  
- Extend into ZZ1 + ZZ2.  
- Mira Mesa store = good template.

### 🧟 Zombie Store Exit

- Customer exits → sees pile of carts + lumber carts.  
- Last memory = clutter.  
- Suggest Electronic BB synced with parking lot BB.


### 🧟 Zombie Backup (BAR Jump in Service Desk) 

- Backup Answered Rate (BAR) was ~3 calls (before getting help).  
- Now 5+ calls.  
- Feels like solo music on HD phone.  
- Not everyone replies, with exceptions of Ken and Karyn (kudos to them).

### 🎼 "On My Way" Reply = Orchestra

- We all carry HD phone. Calls can be heard by assoc and by cust  
- Many don’t reply. A non-replied call = solo. 
- “On my way.” reply → in-store Orchestra  
- Orchestra = better teamwork, better cust experience.
- MOD is the conductor. reinforcing HD Orchestra... 

### "Kicking the Can" Culture

-   Some long-standing issues remain tolerated instead of resolved.\
-   Military phone ID misuse continues.\
-   No-receipt return loophole (splitting large returns into smaller
    transactions).\
-   Return/POS inconsistencies create uneven enforcement.\
-   Got kicked down the street....

### "Not Seeing the Elephant in the Room" (AI)

-   HD.com has at least two AI chat tools.\
-   I've used them at work; they are helpful.\
-   It is 2026 and there has been no in-store rollout or adoption.\
-   Are we giving up the race to Lowes (OpenAI's proxy into the Constructional AI) ?

## Something to Learn:

- **Rental Department** – Want to know how tools work.  
- Expand skill set.  
- Explore Electronic BB idea with team.

---

## Next 6 Months Goals

-   Continue improving OrderUp efficiency and resolution speed.\
-   Monitor Corporate AI direction and Pro customer response.\
